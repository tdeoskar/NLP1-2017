    "## Automatic differentiation with Autograd\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main reasons for using PyTorch is that we can automatically get **gradients/derivatives** of functions that we define. We will mainly use PyTorch for using Neural networks, and they are just fancy functions! If we use weight matrices in our function that we want to learn, then those are called the **parameters** or simply the **weights**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If our Neural Network would output a single scalar value, we would talk about taking the **derivative**, but you will see that quite often we will have **multiple** output variables (\"values\"); in that case we talk about **gradients**. It's a more general term.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an input $\\mathbf{x}$, we define our function by **manipulating** that input, usually by matrix-multiplications with weight matrices and additions with so-called bias vectors. As we manipulate our input, we are automatically creating a **computational graph**. This graph shows how to arrive at our output from our input. \n",
    "PyTorch is a **define-by-run** framework; this means that we can just do our manipulations, and PyTorch will keep track of that graph for us!\n",
    "\n",
    "So, to recap: the only thing we have to do is to compute the **output**, and then we can ask PyTorch to automatically get the **gradients**. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:  Why do we want gradients?** Consider that we have defined a function, a Neural Net, that is supposed to compute a certain output $y$ for an input vector $\\mathbf{x}$. We then define an **error measure** that tells us how wrong our network is; how bad it is in predicting output $y$ from input $\\mathbf{x}$. Based on this error measure, we can use the gradients to **update** the weights $W$ that were responsible for the output, so that the next time we present input $\\mathbf{x}$ to our network, the output will be closer to what we want. \n",

    "## Bag of Words (BOW) classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations, that's the basics! \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now take a look at the BOW model that we showed in the beginning. \n",
    "Given a sentence (a sequence of tokens), we will predict the **sentiment** of that sentence (0 - very negative, ..., 4 - very positive). \n",
    "\n",
    "We associate a learned vector $\\mathbf{w}$ (size $5$) with every token. \n",
    "To determine the sentiment, we will add up the word vectors, also called the **embeddings**, of each token in the sentence. We also add a **bias vector**, which is also a learned vector of size 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can now take a look at `bow-simple.py`.  You will see that the bias vector is missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Always take a look at the **data** first! Open `data/classes/test.txt` in your favorite editor. On Linux/OS X, use `less filename` from the Terminal to open big files without filling your memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Take a look at how the data is *read in* and how the *dictionaries* are created. Make sure you understand how this works. The dictionaries convert words to integers, and this will be very useful when we want to sum the embeddings of certain words in a sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Find the location where the Variable is defined that holds the weights for each token. On a separate line, add another Variable that just holds the **bias** (a vector of size `ntags`). Like the weights, this vector should be initialized randomly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Find the `calc_scores` function and make sure you understand what it does. Then, add the bias parameter to the `score`, before it is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Make sure the bias parameter is also updated after the gradients are calculated. The bias term is updated similarly to how the weights are updated, after `output.backward()` is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Finally, don't forget to zero-out the gradient tensor of the bias parameters after updating. Again, this is similar to the code that zeros out the gradients for the weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, play a bit with your BOW classifier. Does it work well?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## BOW using torch.nn\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `bow-simple.py` code we did a lot of stuff manually; the updates for example.\n",
    "Now take a look at `bow-nn.py`. In this code we use the `torch.nn` package to use some higher-level functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The bias term is missing again; please add it back. This time, you will have to define it in the `__init__` method of the BOW model. Hint: you will need to use `nn.Parameter`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In the `forward` function of the model, make sure to sum the bias that you defined in the previous step.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Now take a look at how the weights are updated. You don't have to change this code, since the optimizer automatically finds all the model parameters (w and b). This code uses the `torch.optim` package to do the same as what we did manually before.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure that you can run this code, and verify that it gives similar results to the manual code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Continious BOW (CBOW) classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've looked at the BOW models, it is time to take a look at `cbow.py`.\n",
    "The difference with BOW is that we can now assign more parameters per token, and this allows us to capture more fine-grained aspects of the tokens. Before, we could only associate how much a token was associated with each class.\n",
    "But now we can use as many dimensions as we like. One dimension could be if the word is an adjective, or if it describes an object. We will now use a separate weight matrix to transform the sum of word representations into the number of classes that we have:\n",
    "$$o = W \\mathbf{x} + b$$\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{x}$ is the sum of the word embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the `__init__` method of the model, add a `nn.Linear` layer to transform a vector of `embedding_dim` into a vector of size `ntags`. Note that the linear layer \"secretly\" defines paramters $W$ and $b$ for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In the `forward` method, apply the `bow` (the sum of word embeddings) to the linear layer, like this: `logits = self.linear(bow)`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Now take a look at the training loop. Did you notice that `lookup_tensor` takes as input a list of sentences? Why is this?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can now play around with this code. You can e.g. try different learning rates, and adding more layers. \n",
    "\n",
    "## That's it! \n",
    "\n",
    "We will release the solutions next week."
